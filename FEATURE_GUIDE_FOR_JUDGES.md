# CareerOS (Pacio) — Complete Feature Guide for Judges

**One line:** CareerOS is an AI-driven *operating system for campus placement intelligence* — it connects students, faculty, TPOs (Training & Placement Officers), recruiters, and institutions on one live command surface, turning raw preparation data (DSA, aptitude, resumes, interviews) into a single forward-looking **Placement Readiness Score** and an executive-grade decision layer.

**Why it matters:** Traditional placement cells run on spreadsheets and look *backwards* (placed vs. unplaced). CareerOS runs on *live signals* and looks *forwards* — predicting outcomes, flagging at-risk students before drives, and giving every stakeholder an AI co-pilot.

**Stack:** React 18 + Tailwind (SPA) · FastAPI (Python) · MongoDB with an in-memory fallback · JWT + Google OAuth auth · deployed on Vercel. Live at **pacio-two.vercel.app**.

## 1. Platform Foundation (the base every feature stands on)

- **Six role-based workspaces (multi-tenant RBAC).** super_admin, institution_admin, tpo, faculty, student, recruiter. Each login lands in a *different* workspace by design, scoped to exactly the data that role may see (institution-scoped, department-scoped, or global). *Why: judges care that a platform claiming "100+ colleges" actually enforces real multi-tenant access control — many student projects don't.*

- **Authentication & security.** Signed JWT sessions (HS256), bcrypt password hashing, Google OAuth sign-in, password reset tokens, and per-request route guards (`require_roles`). *How: every API call is gated by a FastAPI dependency that verifies the token, the role, and the institution scope.*

- **Composite Placement Readiness Score (0–100).** The core metric of the whole platform: a weighted blend of **DSA 30% · Aptitude 20% · ATS 15% · Interview 15% · CGPA 10% · Consistency 10%**, computed from each student's *real* activity (not a self-reported number). Everything else — risk flags, forecasts, recruiter ranking — is derived from this. *Why: it's the single number that makes the platform "intelligent."*

- **Audit trail.** Every sensitive action (login, user/student created, MOU uploaded, health recomputed, payout approved) is written to an audit log with actor, role, institution, IP, and timestamp. *Why: real SaaS accountability.*

- **Resilient data layer.** Runs on MongoDB in production, or a custom in-memory database that mirrors Mongo's query API — so the app runs anywhere, even with zero external dependencies (useful for demos and serverless).

## 2. Role Dashboards (one per persona)

- **TPO — "Placement Command."** Mission-control view: placement rate, offers, top recruiters, application pipeline, interview queue, readiness risks, and a live decision queue of priority actions. The TPO's daily cockpit.

- **Institution Admin — "Institution Console."** Institution-wide health, department comparison, recruiter pipeline, readiness, and board-report decisions.

- **Faculty — "Faculty Console."** Department-scoped: batch size, readiness average, weak-student detection, DSA/aptitude depth, and an intervention roster for the faculty's own department.

- **Student — "Your Workspace."** Personal placement OS: readiness score, DSA/ATS/aptitude progress, ranked next moves, open drives, and applications.

- **Recruiter — "Recruiter Console."** Hiring funnel: open drives, readiness-ranked talent pool, pipeline (Kanban), interview movement, and hiring analytics across partner institutions.

- **Super Admin — "Platform Control."** Global layer: institutions, recruiter network, pending onboarding, platform revenue proxy (MRR), audit activity, and broadcast control.

*How they work: each dashboard calls a single `/api/workspace/me` endpoint that returns a role-specific payload (headline, KPIs, priority actions, alerts, and data sections), so the front end stays thin and every number is computed server-side from live data.*

## 3. AI Intelligence Layer (the differentiator)

This is the layer that makes judges say *"AI platform, not a dashboard."* All of it is computed from real data — no feature depends on a paid LLM to function.

- **AI Executive Summary (live).** A board-ready narrative auto-written at the top of the TPO, Institution, Faculty, and Super Admin dashboards — e.g. *"Placement rate is 72%, 72 of 100 placed; 702 offers across 148 recruiters, averaging 8.3 LPA, peaking at 80 LPA from Amazon; 58 students need intervention. Recommended focus: run a readiness booster."* *How: it reads the live placement/readiness/alert data and composes the sentence; it recomputes per role and per institution. Why: leadership wants the story, not just the chart.*

- **Voice Narration.** A "Narrate" button reads the executive summary aloud using the browser's Speech API (zero cost, zero dependency). *Why: memorable in a live demo — the platform literally talks.*

- **College Health — 6-Factor Breakdown + AI Verdict.** Instead of a single "52," it shows the six drivers — Placement Rate (30%), Training Completion (25%), Communication (15%), MOU Status (15%), FDP Participation (10%), Revenue (5%) — each with score, weight, and a plain-English detail, plus an AI verdict naming the weakest factor.

- **AI Advisor — Next Actions.** Turns the weakest health factors into a ranked action list ("Begin MOU renewal," "Schedule an FDP session," "Run a CRT booster"). *Why: tells you what to *do*, not just what's wrong.*

- **High-Risk Students widget.** Surfaces the lowest-readiness students the engine already flags, with their top risk reason — turning the prediction model into a visible action list. Links to the roster.

- **AI Risk Radar (Super Admin).** Auto-ranks "colleges needing attention this month" by health score (e.g. *"VCE — Health 0 — Poor"*) plus pending-signup risk. *Why: an executive, portfolio-level view of where to intervene.*

- **Artha AI Copilot.** A natural-language analytics assistant embedded across dashboards: ask *"Which department is weakest?"* or *"What if training completion rises 10%?"* and it returns a board-ready answer, an auto-generated chart, anomaly cards, a what-if projection, and an executive report (Strengths / Weaknesses / Predictions / Recommendations). *Why: anyone can interrogate the data in plain English.*

- **What-If Simulator.** Interactive levers (training, resume, interview, DSA) that project expected placements, conversion, expected package, and risk reduction in real time (e.g. *"78 → 94 placements"*). *Why: the most memorable judging moment — leadership can model an intervention live.*

- **Anomaly Detective.** Scans real year-over-year and department data and surfaces **WINNER / ALERT / OPPORTUNITY** cards (e.g. *"Offers up 14% YoY," "ECE placement 48% — below benchmark," "58 students need intervention"*). "AI" via real variance detection, no LLM required.

- **Placement Forecasting.** Projects expected offers this cycle from the open-drive pipeline and historical conversion, with a confidence band (best / likely / worst).

- **Global Search / Command Palette (⌘K).** Press ⌘K to jump anywhere — pages *and* records: students, recruiters, colleges, and drives — all role-scoped. *Why: enterprise navigation across a large platform.*

## How to demo this in 90 seconds (suggested judge flow)

1. **Problem** — open the TPO dashboard: "152 colleges run placements on spreadsheets and find out students aren't ready *during* the drive."

2. **AI insight** — point at the **AI Executive Summary**, hit **Narrate**, show the **Health 6-factor** breakdown and **High-Risk Students**.

3. **Intervention** — open the **Copilot** / **What-If Simulator**: "if we lift training 10%, placements go 78 → 94."

4. **Outcome** — switch to **Recruiter**: pre-ranked talent pool; switch to **Student**: personalized AI action plan. "One platform, every stakeholder, one readiness score."

> Tip for the live demo: open each role's dashboard once a minute before presenting so the serverless backend is warm (first cold load can briefly show zeros). Setting a `MONGO_URL` (MongoDB Atlas) in Vercel removes this entirely.
