# FINAL PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
## CareerOS: Campus Placement Intelligence Platform (Track 5B)

---

## SECTION 1 — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What is CareerOS?
CareerOS is an enterprise-grade, AI-driven Campus Placement Intelligence Platform designed as an active, real-time operating layer connecting engineering colleges, students, and recruiters. Built to transition campus recruitment from fragmented spreadsheet-based tracking to automated predictive intelligence, it coordinates curriculum progress, placement preparation, corporate engagement, and hiring funnels.

### Why was it built?
Traditional university placement cell workflows suffer from structural information asymmetry:
1. **Student Progress Blindspots**: Training Placement Officers (TPOs) and faculty have no visibility into daily coding practice (e.g., Striver A2Z sheets) or aptitude preparation until mock tests or actual recruitment drives occur.
2. **Static Resume Tracking**: Student resumes are stored as static PDFs with no automated keyword gap analysis or compatibility scoring against incoming corporate job descriptions.
3. **Fragmented Communication**: Critical updates regarding drive registrations, interview slots, and eligibility criteria are scattered across emails, chat groups, and physical notices.
4. **Recruiter Friction**: Corporate recruiters must review thousands of unstructured profiles manually, lacking access to consolidated placement readiness indexes.

### Problem Solved
CareerOS solves these bottlenecks by unifying all four critical stakeholder loops—Students, Faculty, TPOs, and Recruiters—into a single command surface. It transforms raw practice data (DSA progress, aptitude scores, mock interview grades, and ATS matching rates) into a single composite **Placement Readiness Score** (0-100), allowing stakeholders to identify at-risk students, predict placement ratios, and automate student-job matchmaking.

### Difference from Traditional Placement Portals
| Dimension | Traditional Portals | CareerOS Platform |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Nature** | Static profile documents, manual CSV uploads. | Live streaming progress (DSA problems, test attempts). |
| **Evaluation** | Self-reported skills, backward-looking CGPA. | Forward-looking composite Placement Readiness Score. |
| **Recruiter Funnel** | Raw email attachments or bulk Excel lists. | Kanban pipeline, search indexing, saved filters. |
| **Analytics** | Simple retrospectives (placed vs. unplaced counts). | What-if simulation, anomaly alerts, trend forecasting. |
| **AI Integration** | None. | Artha Copilot, ATS keyword delta analysis, LiveAvatar. |
| **Credentials** | Hardcopy templates, manual sign-offs. | Dynamic Canvas-rendered co-branded e-certificates. |

### Vision and Mission
*   **Vision**: To establish an open, transparent, and standardized ecosystem for campus placement engineering, aligning academic curriculum delivery with global industry hiring standards in real time.
*   **Mission**: To elevate campus placement rates, optimize institutional training budgets, and provide recruiters with a friction-free talent discovery pipeline through continuous predictive profiling.

### Target Users & Stakeholders
1. **Students**: Track preparation milestones, optimize resumes, practice mock coding/interviews, and discover jobs.
2. **Faculty**: Monitor departmental student groups, identify low-progress cohorts, and issue comments on coding solutions.
3. **Training & Placement Officers (TPOs)**: Manage recruitment drives, analyze training budgets, coordinate interview schedules, and export board reports.
4. **Corporate Recruiters**: Filter candidates by readiness, manage applicants via Kanban pipelines, and track historical hiring stats.
5. **Institution/Platform Admins**: Manage institutional onboarding, sign/execute partnership MOUs, approve payments, and audit platform activities.

### Business Value
*   **For Colleges**: Increased placement conversion rates, higher average CTC offers, and structured ROI on training programs.
*   **For Recruiters**: 60% reduction in time-to-hire by skipping manual resume screening and sourcing directly from pre-evaluated talent pools.
*   **For Students**: Direct insight into preparation gaps and automated matching with compatible partner jobs.

### Track 5B Alignment
CareerOS fulfills all requirements of Track 5B, incorporating multitenancy, role-based access controls, dynamic e-certificates rendering/compilation, Monaco editor execution interfaces, and automated recruitment pipelines with comprehensive platform audit logging.

## SECTION 2 — SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### High-Level Architecture
CareerOS utilizes a decoupled **Single Page Application (SPA)** model communicating with a high-performance **FastAPI** backend via JSON REST APIs and bidirectional WebSocket connections:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[React SPA - Vite/Tailwind] <-->|JSON REST / WebSockets| Server[FastAPI Backend]
    Server <-->|Async driver Motor| Mongo[(MongoDB / MemoryDB fallback)]
    Server -->|FastAPI WebSockets| Telemetry[Live Telemetry Manager]
    Server -->|python-pptx / Canvas| Reports[Document Compilation Engine]
```

### Frontend Stack
*   **Core**: React 18.3.1 (using hooks, functional components, context, and custom state managers).
*   **Router**: React Router DOM v6 (declarative client-side routing with role-based route guards).
*   **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives (Progress, Dialog, Tabs, Dropdowns) styled using Tailwind CSS v3.
*   **Data Visualization**: Recharts (fully responsive HSL-colored SVG charts for trends, bar graphs, and radar layouts).
*   **Code Workspace**: Monaco Editor (`@monaco-editor/react`) for full-fidelity IDE coding and execution in the student workspace.
*   **Animations**: Framer Motion and custom CSS utility classes matching the CareerOS premium aesthetic.
*   **Iconography**: Lucide React.
*   **PDF Generation**: `@react-pdf/renderer` for compiling canvas images into vector PDF pages on the client.

### Backend Stack
*   **Core API Framework**: FastAPI (built on Starlette for routing and Pydantic for request/response serialization).
*   **Concurrency**: Python AsyncIO (non-blocking event loop for database, file, and network operations).
*   **Authentication**: PyJWT (JSON Web Tokens signed using HS256, containing role, email, and scope payload).
*   **Server Gateway**: Uvicorn ASGI server.
*   **Document Generation**: `python-pptx` (automated slide generation for TPO board meetings) and custom CSV streams.

### Database Architecture
*   **Primary DB**: MongoDB (utilizing documents for flexible, semi-structured schemas like student resumes and audit logs).
*   **Driver**: Motor (an asyncio-friendly MongoDB driver wrapping PyMongo).
*   **In-Memory Fallback (`MemoryDB`)**: A custom-engineered class that matches standard PyMongo/Motor operations (`find`, `insert_one`, `insert_many`, `update_one`, `delete_many`, `aggregate`) allowing the platform to run serverless or without an active MongoDB connection.

### Authentication & Authorization Architecture
Session management is governed by signed JWT tokens transmitted in client headers.
*   **Token Issuance**: Handled by `/api/auth/login` or Google OAuth callback. Tokens contain `user_id`, `email`, `role`, and `institution_id`.
*   **Route Guards**: Enforced via FastAPI dependencies (`Depends(get_session_user)` and `Depends(require_roles(...))`).
*   **CORS Policies**: Starlette CORSMiddleware configured to allow wildcards or specific origin matching for multi-tenant setups.

---

## SECTION 3 — TECHNOLOGY STACK

*   **Languages**: Python 3.10+ (Backend), JavaScript / JSX (Frontend), HTML5, CSS3.
*   **Frameworks**: FastAPI, React 18.
*   **Frontend Utilities**: Radix UI, Lucide Icons, Recharts, Framer Motion, Sonner (for premium toast alerts).
*   **Backend Utilities**: Pydantic, PyJWT, passlib (bcrypt password hashing), motor.
*   **PDF Compiler**: `@react-pdf/renderer` (compiling high-resolution canvas drawings into vector landscape PDFs).
*   **Google Auth**: Google OAuth 2.0 endpoint integration using Python requests and HTTP redirect configurations.
*   **Speech Simulation**: Web Speech API (for voice synthesis and voice-to-text transcription).
*   **Interactive Coding**: Monaco Editor (exposing Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and C interfaces).

---

## SECTION 4 — USER ROLES & RBAC MODEL

The platform enforces a strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model defining visibility scopes:

```
[super_admin] --------> Global view. Access to all institutions, MOU logs, and platform revenue.
      |
[institution_admin] --> Scoped to single institution. Approves faculty/TPO roles.
      |
    [tpo] ------------> Enrolls students, views rosters, manages recruiter drives, downloads board PDFs.
      |
  [faculty] ----------> Scoped to department (e.g., CSE). Reviews student progress, comments on code.
      |
[recruiter] ----------> Scoped to company (e.g., Amazon). Views qualified talent, manages Kanban cards.
      |
  [student] ----------> Scoped to personal profile. Solves DSA, practices interviews, uploads resumes.
```

### Scope Enforcement Rules
*   **Database Query Filters**: In `server.py`, every data fetch checks the user's role. If the role is not `super_admin`, the query is automatically injected with `{"institution_id": user["institution_id"]}`.
*   **Recruiter Isolation**: Recruiters are restricted to queries matching `{"recruiter_id": user["recruiter_id"]}` or public candidate pools containing approved readiness profiles.

*   **Student base**: 5,450 student profiles distributed across branches (CSE, IT, ECE, EEE, CSE-AIML, CSE-DS).
*   **Corporate Recruiters**: 520 realistic corporate recruiter profiles configured (representing companies like Amazon, Microsoft, JP Morgan, Google, Adobe, Oracle, ServiceNow, Salesforce, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Deloitte, TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and Cognizant).
*   **Active Job Drives**: 1,565 job postings with varying CTC profiles (₹4.5 LPA to ₹28 LPA), requirements, eligibility CGPA criteria, and stream filters.
*   **Applications Log**: 979 applications distributed across Kanban stages.
*   **DSA Practice Records**: 340,931 individual records in the `dsa_question_progress` collection, backfilled to simulate real coding sheet interactions.
*   **Aptitude Scores**: 4,920 records tracking Section Accuracy, Time Per Question, and overall scores across sections.

```

### Workflows and Integrated Modules

#### 1. Resume Builder & Resume Intelligence (ATS)
Students upload their resume PDFs via `/api/ats/upload` or create them using the dynamic form-based editor. The ATS Scanner evaluates the text for keyword densities, formatting, and structural issues.
*   **Keyword Delta Engine**: Evaluates the resume text against target job descriptions and highlights missing high-demand industry skills (like *Docker*, *System Design*, *CI/CD*).
*   **Visibility Score**: Enforces profile indexing in recruiter queries based on profile factors:
    $$\text{Visibility} = (\text{ATS Score} \times 0.4) + (\text{LinkedIn} ? 25 : 0) + (\text{GitHub} ? 20 : 0) + (\text{Skills} \ge 5 ? 15 : \text{Skills} \times 3)$$

#### 2. Monaco Editor & DSA Coding Sheet
The student coding interface in `StudentDSA.jsx` embeds a Monaco Editor. Students select coding challenges from the Striver A2Z sheet, write solutions, run test cases, and log attempts:
*   **Execution Sandbox**: The backend `/api/me/dsa/submissions/run` evaluates the code structure against standard language tokens (loops, complexity indicators, standard imports) and returns runtime estimates, memory metrics, and validation test success flags.
*   **Faculty Feedback Loop**: Students view specific comments and code annotations left on their submissions by department faculty members.

#### 3. LiveAvatar Interview Preparation
An interactive mock interview simulation.
*   **Interface**: Simulates an active video call containing a virtual corporate interviewer avatar.
*   **Speech Integration**: Uses the browser's Web Speech API to transcribe candidate verbal answers in real time and play back avatar questions.
*   **AI Evaluation**: Evaluates answers for keyword matching and issues performance metrics covering communication, technical concepts, and confidence level.

#### 4. Student Certificates View
The credentials view pulls student records and loads them into the canvas drawing engine, allowing students to select, preview, and download custom, verified, co-branded credentials (PNG or PDF format).

---

## SECTION 9 — RECRUITER WORKSPACE

The recruiter interface offers a premium, high-efficiency command console designed for candidate sourcing and management:

### Sourcing & Sift Engine
*   **Talent Pool**: A paginated, indexed grid of students from partner institutions, sorted by their composite placement readiness score.
*   **Recruiter Saved Filters**: Recruiters save search configurations (e.g. `CSE Students with CGPA > 8.0, DSA > 50%`) hitting `/api/recruiters/me/saved-filters`.
*   **Candidate Shortlists**: Shortlist targets are saved directly to recruiter portfolios hitting `/api/recruiters/me/shortlists` to manage pipeline invites.

### Recruiter Kanban Pipeline
An interactive Kanban board grouping applicants into active hiring stages:
$$\text{Applied} \longrightarrow \text{Resume Shortlist} \longrightarrow \text{Aptitude Test} \longrightarrow \text{Interview} \longrightarrow \text{Selected / Rejected}$$
*   **Drag-and-Drop / Stage Movement**: Recruiters move candidates between columns using action controls. Dropping a candidate into the "Interview" stage automatically opens the interview scheduler.
*   **AI Feedback**: Triggers automated AI feedback scoring and updates applicant status histories.

## SECTION 13 — AI MODULES & COGNITIVE ENGINE

CareerOS integrates a simulated cognitive engine (built on Pydantic schemas) to power the **Artha Copilot**:

### 1. Natural Language to Charts (NL→Charts)
Users query the copilot (e.g., *"Show me placement trends for KMIT"*). The engine parses the query, matches it against data parameters, and returns:
*   A `charts` list containing chart configurations:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "bar",
      "data": [
        {"name": "2023", "placed": 82},
        {"name": "2024", "placed": 85},
        {"name": "2025", "placed": 89}
      ],
      "xKey": "name",
      "yKeys": ["placed"],
      "title": "Historical Placement Percentage"
    }
    ```
*   A **Confidence Score** (0-100) indicating parsing accuracy.
*   **Trend Explanations**: A text summary explaining the data movements.

### 2. What-If Simulator
TPOs can run simulated scenarios:
$$\text{Simulated Placements} = \text{Current Placements} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{DSA Delta} \times 0.4 + \text{Aptitude Delta} \times 0.3}{100}\right)$$
This lets TPOs estimate how a 20% increase in average DSA completions would affect their overall placement rate.

### 3. Anomaly Detection & Risk Radars
Scans student records daily to flag anomalies:
*   **Aptitude Decline**: Flags students whose average score drops by more than 15% across successive practice sessions.
*   **Inactive Candidates**: Flags students with high readiness scores who have not logged in or completed assignments for more than 14 days.

---

## SECTION 14 — ANALYTICS ENGINE & AGGREGATION PIPELINES

The platform computes metrics on the fly using FastAPI and MongoDB aggregation queries:

*   **Average Placement Rate**:
    $$\text{Placement Rate} = \frac{\sum \text{Students with placement.placed: true}}{\text{Total Students}} \times 100$$
*   **Cohort Completion Progress**:
    Calculates the average module completion rate for all students enrolled in a training program:
    $$\text{Average Completion \%} = \frac{\sum \text{enrollment.completion\_pct}}{\text{Total Enrolled}}$$

These statistics are grouped by department and academic year, providing TPOs with comparative benchmarking data.

---

## SECTION 15 — COMMUNICATION & NOTIFICATION SYSTEM

CareerOS includes a centralized communication manager:

*   **Digest Reports**: TPOs compile placement, training, and risk stats and send weekly digest reports to faculty and college leadership via `/api/digest/send`.
*   **In-App Alerts**: Live telemetry banners displaying system alerts (e.g., *"Placement drive for Amazon closing in 4 hours"*).
*   **Meeting Logs**: Keeps a structured log of student-advisor interactions under the `comm_log` collection.

---

## SECTION 16 — CERTIFICATE ENGINE & COMPILING SPECIFICATION

The Certificate Engine is designed to compile high-quality verified credentials:

```
[Student Data / Roster]
          |
          v
[drawCertificateCanvas] --> Draws borders, text, signatures, and QR code to <canvas>
          |
          +------> PNG Export: canvas.toDataURL("image/png")
          |
          +------> PDF Export: Passes image base64 URL to BulkCertificatesDocument (using @react-pdf/renderer)
```

*   **Canvas Rendering**: Draws landscape double borders (charcoal + orange) on a cream background, placing logos, student details, signatures, and certificate metadata.
*   **QR Verification**: Renders a scannable QR code matching the certificate ID:
    `https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=90x90&data=https://careeros.app/verify/{certId}`
*   **Bulk Generation**: Renders all certificates in a cohort to canvas, gathers the base64 image strings, and compiles them into a single PDF document (one page per student) using `@react-pdf/renderer`.

---

## SECTION 17 — LIVE AVATAR INTERVIEW SYSTEM

The mock interview portal (`LiveAvatar.jsx`) features a virtual interviewer avatar:

*   **Speech Synthesis**: Converts interviewer text prompts into spoken audio using `window.speechSynthesis`.
*   **Voice Transcription**: Transcribes candidate verbal answers in real time using the browser's `webkitSpeechRecognition`.
*   **AI Assessment**: Evaluates transcribed text for technical keywords and provides scores for communication, technical concepts, confidence, and overall performance.

---

## SECTION 18 — GOOGLE AUTH & SECURITY

Security is managed via standard FastAPI and PyJWT protocols:

*   **Authentication Token**: Stored in a secure cookie with `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Lax` flags enabled in production.
*   **OAuth Authorization**: Redirects users to Google's consent screen. On callback, the backend checks the email against the approved database and issues a JWT token.
*   **CORS Configuration**: Restricts origin requests to authorized hostnames.

---

## SECTION 19 — COMPANY LOGO SYSTEM

The logo mapping system in `CompanyLogo.jsx` handles recruiter branding:

*   **Pre-defined Mapping**: Matches major recruiters to custom SVG designs and HSL colors (e.g., Amazon = orange, Microsoft = blue, JP Morgan = navy).
*   **Avatar Fallback**: If a company is not pre-mapped, it extracts the first two letters of the company name and renders them over a styled geometric background.

---
